## For Translators ##

[Some general translation tips (WordPress documentation)](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/localization/#tips-for-good-translations).

[Read more on how to translate .PO file (WordPress documentation)](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/localization/#translate-po-file). I recommend using [Poedit translation tool](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/localization/#poedit).

If you have created your own translation or have an update of an existing one, please send it to dasha@dashaluna.com or create a pull request on [github repository](https://github.com/dashaluna/hm-content-toc), so I can bundle it into the next release of the plugin.

Please send the following:

1. Only .PO file, the corresponding .MO file will be generated by me.
2. Your wordpress.org username, so I can credit you.

Thank you!
